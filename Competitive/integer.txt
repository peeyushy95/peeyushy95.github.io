Any integer can be expressed in the form of 4k + r. r belongs to (0, 1, 2, 3). 
Also the square of any integer can only have r as 0 or 1.
P%4 ==1 or 3 where p is odd prime.
Fermat’s theorem states that an ODD prime number p can be expressed as                        p = x² + y² with integer x and y iff  P%4=1.
If we square such an odd prime P ( P%4=3 ) then (4k + 3) * (4k + 3) will become (4k’ + 1). So if the power of an odd prime number is EVEN then it will be of the form of 4k + 1.
now num=p^2n  is a square bcz  num%4=1,  (a²+b²)*num=(a(p^n)) ² + (b(p^n)) ²
Fibonacci’s identity: - The product of two sums each of two squares is itself a sum of two squares i.e. for integers a, b, c, d . (a² + b²) (c² + d²) = (ac – bd) ² + (ad + bc) ² = (ac + bd) ² + (ad – bc) ² 
XOR of 1 to N =>     0 if (N%4==0 || N%4==3),     1 if (N%4==1),       N+1 if (N%4==2)
1² + 2² + …. n²  =    (n*(n+1)(2n+1))/6   =    (N+2)C(3)  +  (N+3)C(3);
X%n == x&(n-1) if n is power of 2
